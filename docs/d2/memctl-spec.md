MEMCTL — NanoClaw Memory Governance System
Implementation Specification v1.0
================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
memctl is a Go CLI binary that manages atomic memory notes for a
NanoClaw agent. It maintains a CLAUDE.md index for fast agent
lookup, enforces note schema at write time, detects and reports
index drift via hash verification, and runs scripted pruning/
archival of orphaned or stale notes.

All operations that modify state are scripted (no LLM involvement).
The agent's role is limited to: writing new notes via `memctl new`,
reading the index, and following the lookup protocol defined in
CLAUDE.md. The agent never directly edits the index or runs pruning.

Design invariants:
  - Notes are immutable after creation except via `memctl edit`
  - The index is always derivable from the notes corpus (rebuild is lossless)
  - Pruning never deletes — it archives with a tombstone
  - Config drives all thresholds; no magic numbers in code
  - Every command is safe to run as --dry-run first

================================================================
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
================================================================

memory/
  notes/          # atomic note files (one claim per file)
  archive/        # pruned notes (tombstoned, not deleted)
  backlinks/      # auto-generated backlink graph (JSON, one per entity)

CLAUDE.md         # agent-facing index (auto-maintained by memctl)
memctl.yaml       # config file
memctl            # compiled binary

NOTE FILE FORMAT
================================================================

Filename: {ISO8601-compact}-{slug}.md
Example:  20260315-143022-postgres-chosen-for-auth.md

Every note MUST be parseable as YAML frontmatter + plaintext body.
If it cannot be expressed in this schema, it is not a valid note.

--- SCHEMA ---

---
id: "20260315-143022"          # timestamp, set at creation, immutable
title: "Postgres chosen over MongoDB for auth surface"
type: decision                  # decision | fact | reference | project | person | event
tags:
  - postgres
  - mongodb
  - auth
  - database
entities:                       # named things this note is about
  - alice
  - project-alpha
backlinks:                      # IDs of notes that reference this one (auto-maintained)
  - "20260314-091500"
confidence: high                # high | medium | low
created: "2026-03-15T14:30:22Z"
modified: "2026-03-15T14:30:22Z"
expires: null                   # optional: ISO8601 date after which note is stale
---

Single plaintext sentence or short paragraph stating the claim.
No sub-headings. No lists. If you need a list, it's multiple notes.

--- END SCHEMA ---

Enforcement: `memctl new` validates schema before writing.
Invalid notes are rejected with a descriptive error. The agent
is told exactly what field is missing or malformed.

Valid types and their semantics:
  decision  - a choice that was made (immutable once true)
  fact      - an observable state (may become stale)
  reference - a pointer to an external resource
  project   - a project entity (top-level organisational node)
  person    - a person entity
  event     - something that happened at a point in time

================================================================
CLAUDE.md INDEX FORMAT
================================================================

The CLAUDE.md file has two sections:
  1. LOOKUP PROTOCOL — instructions for the agent (human-readable)
  2. MEMORY_INDEX — machine-parseable YAML block

The agent reads this file on every session start.
The index is updated by memctl, never by the agent directly.

--- CLAUDE.md TEMPLATE ---

# MEMORY INDEX
<!-- AUTO-MAINTAINED BY memctl — DO NOT HAND-EDIT THE YAML BLOCK -->
<!-- Run: memctl index verify   to check for drift              -->
<!-- Run: memctl index rebuild  to regenerate from notes corpus -->

## LOOKUP PROTOCOL

When answering a question that may depend on stored memory:

1. Parse MEMORY_INDEX below. Identify candidate notes by:
   a. entity intersection (does the query mention a known entity?)
   b. tag intersection (does the query map to known tags?)
   c. type filter (decisions? facts? people?)

2. For each candidate, check: does the hash in the index match
   the file? If not, flag drift and re-read the file directly.
   Run `memctl index verify` to surface all drift.

3. Load only the matching note files. Do not load the full corpus.

4. If no candidates match, say so. Do not hallucinate memory.

5. To write a new note: call `memctl new` with structured args.
   Do not write to memory files directly.

6. A note with type=decision is treated as authoritative.
   A note with confidence=low should be stated with uncertainty.
   A note with an expires date in the past should be treated as stale.

## MEMORY_INDEX
```yaml
generated: "2026-03-15T14:30:22Z"
note_count: 47
entities:
  - alice
  - bob
  - project-alpha
  - project-beta
tag_vocabulary:
  - postgres
  - auth
  - database
  - deadline
  # ... full controlled vocab

notes:
  - id: "20260315-143022"
    file: "memory/notes/20260315-143022-postgres-chosen-for-auth.md"
    title: "Postgres chosen over MongoDB for auth surface"
    type: decision
    tags: [postgres, mongodb, auth, database]
    entities: [alice, project-alpha]
    summary: "Chose Postgres. Alice owns auth. JWT expiry 24h."

COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS
================================================================

-- memctl new --

PURPOSE: Write a validated atomic note. The agent calls this.
         Never writes files directly.

FLAGS:
  --title         string   Note title (required)
  --type          string   Note type from valid_types (required)
  --tags          strings  Comma-separated tags (required, min 1)
  --entities      strings  Comma-separated entity names (optional)
  --confidence    string   high|medium|low (default: high)
  --body          string   Single-claim body text (required)
  --expires       string   ISO8601 expiry date (optional)
  --link-to       string   ID of note this links back to (optional)

BEHAVIOUR:
  1. Validate all fields against schema and controlled vocabulary
  2. Warn (not error) on unknown tags — suggest nearest match
  3. Generate ID from current timestamp
  4. Generate filename from ID + slugified title
  5. Write file to memory/notes/
  6. Update backlinks: if --link-to provided, append this note's
     ID to the target note's backlinks field
  7. Update MEMORY_INDEX entry in CLAUDE.md (append only)
  8. Print: note ID, filename, any tag warnings

OUTPUT (--json):
  {
    "id": "20260315-143022",
    "file": "memory/notes/20260315-143022-postgres-chosen-for-auth.md",
    "warnings": ["unknown tag 'foobar' — nearest: 'database'"]
  }

EXAMPLE:
  memctl new \
    --title "Postgres chosen over MongoDB for auth surface" \
    --type decision \
    --tags postgres,mongodb,auth,database \
    --entities alice,project-alpha \
    --confidence high \
    --body "Chose Postgres for auth. Alice owns this surface. JWT expiry set to 24h."


-- memctl search --

PURPOSE: Search notes by tag, entity, type, or full-text.
         Returns file paths — agent then reads files directly.
         Does NOT load file content. Stays token-efficient.

FLAGS:
  --tags        strings   Match notes containing ALL of these tags
  --entities    strings   Match notes referencing ANY of these entities
  --type        string    Filter by note type
  --text        string    Full-text search in title and body
  --since       string    ISO8601 — only notes modified after this date
  --expired                Include notes past their expires date
  --limit       int        Max results (default: 20)

OUTPUT:
  List of matching file paths, one per line.
  With --json: array of index entries (no file body).

EXAMPLE:
  memctl search --entities alice --type decision
  # Returns paths to all decision notes about alice


-- memctl index rebuild --

PURPOSE: Regenerate CLAUDE.md MEMORY_INDEX from scratch.
         Safe to run any time. Idempotent.

BEHAVIOUR:
  1. Walk memory/notes/
  2. Parse each note's frontmatter
  3. Compute SHA256 hash of file content
  4. Truncate note body to max_summary_chars for summary field
  5. Write fresh MEMORY_INDEX block to CLAUDE.md
  6. Preserve LOOKUP PROTOCOL section (never overwrites it)
  7. Print: notes processed, time taken, any parse errors

FLAGS:
  --dry-run    Show what would be written without writing


-- memctl index verify --

PURPOSE: Hash-check all index entries against current file content.
         Reports drift. Non-zero exit if any drift found.

BEHAVIOUR:
  1. For each entry in MEMORY_INDEX, compute hash of current file
  2. Compare against stored hash
  3. Report: MATCH | DRIFT | MISSING (file deleted) | ORPHAN (file exists, not in index)
  4. Suggest remediation: `memctl index rebuild` or `memctl new`

OUTPUT:
  MATCH   20260315-143022  postgres-chosen-for-auth.md
  DRIFT   20260314-091500  alice-owns-auth.md  (file modified since index)
  ORPHAN  20260316-120000  new-unindexed-note.md

Exit code 3 if any DRIFT or MISSING found.
Exit code 0 if all MATCH (ORPHAN is a warning, not an error).


-- memctl link --

PURPOSE: Add a backlink between two notes.
         The agent calls this when it creates a note that
         references an existing one.

FLAGS:
  --from    string   ID of the note doing the referencing (required)
  --to      string   ID of the note being referenced (required)

BEHAVIOUR:
  1. Append --from ID to the backlinks field of --to note
  2. Recompute hash, update index entry
  3. Print confirmation

EXAMPLE:
  memctl link --from 20260315-143022 --to 20260314-091500


-- memctl prune --

PURPOSE: Identify and archive notes below the prune score threshold.
         ALWAYS defaults to --dry-run. Explicit --execute required.
         Never deletes — moves to archive/ with tombstone.

PRUNE SCORE ALGORITHM:
  recency = exp(-days_since_modified / half_life_days)
  score   = backlink_count * recency

  If backlink_count >= min_backlinks_to_exempt: exempt (never pruned)
  If score < min_score: archive candidate

  Special cases:
    type=decision: exempt regardless of score (decisions are permanent)
    type=person:   exempt regardless of score
    expired=true:  score halved (faster path to archival)

FLAGS:
  --dry-run    Print candidates without acting (DEFAULT)
  --execute    Actually archive candidates (requires explicit flag)
  --since      Only consider notes older than this date
  --min-score  Override config threshold for this run

BEHAVIOUR (--execute):
  1. For each archive candidate:
     a. Move file to memory/archive/{id}-archived-{date}.md
     b. Write tombstone entry to MEMORY_INDEX:
        status: archived
        archived_at: ISO8601
        reason: score={n} below threshold={n}
     c. Remove full index entry; replace with tombstone
  2. Print: n notes archived, n exempt, n below threshold

OUTPUT (--dry-run):
  CANDIDATE  20260301-100000  old-mongodb-note.md  score=0.04  (threshold=0.15)
  EXEMPT     20260315-143022  postgres-decision.md  type=decision
  CANDIDATE  20260228-090000  stale-fact.md  score=0.09  expired=true


-- memctl stats --

PURPOSE: Corpus health report. Run periodically or before pruning.

OUTPUT:
  Notes:          47
  Archived:       12
  Orphaned:        2  (not in index — run: memctl index rebuild)
  Drifted:         1  (modified since index — run: memctl index verify)

  By type:
    decision        18
    fact            14
    reference        7
    project          4
    person           3
    event            1

  Score distribution:
    > 0.50   (healthy):   31
    0.15–0.50 (ok):       10
    < 0.15   (prune zone): 6

  Entities: 14 unique

## HOW TO USE MEMORY

### Writing a note
Always use memctl. Never write to memory files directly.

  memctl new \
    --title "Short factual title" \
    --type [decision|fact|reference|project|person|event] \
    --tags tag1,tag2 \
    --entities entity1,entity2 \
    --confidence [high|medium|low] \
    --body "Single claim. One sentence if possible."

One claim per note. If you need to record two things, run memctl new twice.

Use --link-to <id> if the new note references an existing one.
After writing, run: memctl index verify

### Reading memory
1. Scan MEMORY_INDEX below for candidates by entity + tag intersection
2. Load only matching files — do not load the full corpus
3. Check: does the hash in the index match the file?
   If not: run `memctl index verify` and report drift before continuing
4. type=decision notes are authoritative
5. confidence=low notes should be stated with uncertainty
6. Notes past their expires date are stale — state this explicitly

### What you must not do
- Do not hand-edit CLAUDE.md or any note file
- Do not invent backlinks — use memctl link
- Do not prune or archive notes — that is a scripted job
- Do not write notes with multiple claims

### When to write a note
- A decision was made → type=decision
- A fact was established that will matter in future sessions → type=fact
- A person was introduced with relevant context → type=person
- A project was scoped or descoped → type=project
- Do not write notes for transient conversational context
