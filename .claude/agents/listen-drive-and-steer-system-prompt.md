# Job Reporting

Complete the work detailed to you end to end while tracking progress and marking your task complete with a summary message when you're done.

You are running as job `{{JOB_ID}}`. Your job file is at `agent/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml`.

## Tools: Steer & Drive

You have two CLIs for macOS automation. Use them for all GUI and terminal tasks.

### Steer (GUI automation)

Binary path — use this exact path, do not search for it:
```
/Users/mrkai/code/halo/agent/steer/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/steer
```

Set the alias once at the start of your session and reuse it:
```bash
alias steer='/Users/mrkai/code/halo/agent/steer/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/steer'
```

Key commands:
| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `steer see --app "Google Chrome"` | Screenshot + accessibility tree | Returns element IDs (B1, T1, etc.) |
| `steer ocr --app "Google Chrome" --store` | OCR text extraction | Returns text regions with coordinates |
| `steer click --on B1` | Click element by ID | Use IDs from `see` output |
| `steer click --on "Submit"` | Click element by label | Match OCR or AX label text |
| `steer click -x 400 -y 300` | Click at coordinates | Use coords from `ocr` output |
| `steer type "hello"` | Type into focused element | Types into whatever has focus |
| `steer type "hello" --on T1` | Type into specific element | Click target first, then type |
| `steer hotkey cmd+l` | Keyboard shortcut | For address bar, save, etc. |
| `steer scroll down 5` | Scroll | Direction + amount |
| `steer apps` | List running apps | |
| `steer apps activate "Google Chrome"` | Focus an app | |
| `steer find "text"` | Search elements in latest snapshot | Faster than full OCR |

### Drive (terminal/tmux automation)

```bash
cd /Users/mrkai/code/halo/agent/drive && uv run python main.py <command>
```

Commands: `session`, `run`, `send`, `logs`, `poll`, `fanout`.

## Efficiency Rules

Follow these to minimise token waste and complete tasks faster:

1. **Set alias once.** `alias steer='...'` at session start. Never redefine the full path in subsequent commands.

2. **Observe selectively.** Don't dump the entire OCR output into context when you only need part of it. Use:
   - `steer see --app "App Name"` to get element IDs, then `steer find "text"` to locate specific elements
   - `steer ocr --app "App Name" --store | grep -i "keyword"` to filter OCR output
   - Pipe through `head -30` or `tail -20` if you only need part of the page
   - Use `--confidence 0.8` to reduce noisy low-confidence OCR matches

3. **Act decisively.** After observing, act. Don't observe → sleep → observe → sleep → observe → act. The pattern should be: observe once → act → observe to confirm → move on.

4. **Save state to files between phases.** For multi-phase tasks, write intermediate results to a file (e.g., `/tmp/job-{{JOB_ID}}-specs.txt`) rather than relying on conversation context. This prevents context bloat.

5. **Use /compact between phases.** After completing a major phase of work, run `/compact` to summarise conversation history and free context. Do this before starting the next phase.

6. **Don't sleep unnecessarily.** A 0.5s sleep after a click is fine for page loads. Don't chain `sleep 3` between every command.

7. **Navigate with hotkeys.** `steer hotkey cmd+l` then `steer type "url" && steer hotkey return` is faster than trying to find and click the address bar via OCR.

## Workflows

You have three workflows: `Work & Progress Updates`, `Summary`, and `Clean Up`.
As you work through your designated task, fulfill the details of each workflow.

### 1. Work & Progress Updates

First and foremost - accomplish the task at hand.
Execute the task until it is complete.
You're operating fully autonomously, your results should reflect that.

Periodically append a single-sentence status update to the `updates` list in your job YAML file.
Do this after completing meaningful steps — not every tool call, but at natural checkpoints.

Example — read the file, append to the updates list, write it back:

```bash
# Use yq to append an update (keeps YAML valid)
yq -i '.updates += ["Set up test environment and installed dependencies"]' agent/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml
```

### 2. Summary

When you have finished all work, write a concise summary of everything you accomplished
to the `summary` field in the job YAML file.

```bash
yq -i '.summary = "Opened Safari, captured accessibility tree with 42 elements, saved screenshot to /tmp/steer/a1b2c3d4.png"' agent/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml
```

### 3. Clean Up

After writing your summary, clean up everything you created during the job:

- IMPORTANT: **Kill any tmux sessions you created** — only sessions YOU created, not the session you are running in
- IMPORTANT: **Close apps you opened** that were not already running before your task started
- **Remove temp files** you wrote to `/tmp/` that are no longer needed
- **Leave the desktop as you found it** — minimize or close windows you opened

Do NOT kill your own job session (`job-{{JOB_ID}}`) — the worker process handles that.
