Defect survival probability = product of survival probability at each independent gate. Four layers: (1) local quality gate (typecheck+lint+test, primary authority, CI is backstop), (2) adversarial review (3 independent models, structured YAML, convergence builds confidence), (3) human walkthrough (catches 'not wrong', cannot be automated), (4) post-merge verification. Same-model agreement is consistency, not validation. True independent signal requires different model families.
