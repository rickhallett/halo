"""
memctl enrich — Semantic backlink proposal engine.

Analyses the note corpus and proposes backlinks the tag/entity model
would miss. Outputs a muster-format batch for human approval.

Scoring rubric (5 dimensions, each 0-2, max score 10):

  SEMANTIC_BRIDGE (0-2)
    Does this link connect ideas that share meaning but not metadata?
    0 = already connected by shared tags/entities (redundant)
    1 = partial metadata overlap but the link adds a non-obvious axis
    2 = no metadata overlap; connection is purely semantic

  CROSS_TYPE (0-2)
    Do the notes have different types?
    0 = same type (fact<->fact, decision<->decision)
    1 = related types (fact<->reference, decision<->fact)
    2 = distant types (person<->decision, project<->vulnerability)

  CAUSAL_DIRECTION (0-2)
    Is there a causal or temporal relationship?
    0 = no directionality (both just co-exist)
    1 = weak direction (one informs the other)
    2 = clear causal chain (problem->solution, diagnosis->correction, principle->application)

  CLUSTER_VALUE (0-2)
    Does this link form or strengthen a meaningful cluster?
    0 = isolated pair, doesn't connect to anything else
    1 = extends an existing cluster by one hop
    2 = bridges two previously disconnected clusters

  RECALL_UTILITY (0-2)
    Would a future query benefit from traversing this link?
    0 = unlikely to be traversed (decorative connection)
    1 = useful in specific contexts
    2 = high probability of improving retrieval (the "I wouldn't have found this otherwise" test)

THRESHOLDS:
  >= 7: strong link, high confidence proposal
  5-6:  moderate link, include in muster with context
  3-4:  weak link, include only if --verbose
  < 3:  skip

FILTERS (applied before scoring):
  - Skip pairs where both notes are type=person (biographical noise)
  - Skip pairs where the only shared entity is "kai" (too generic)
  - Skip pairs already linked
  - Skip pairs where shared_tags >= 3 (already well-connected by metadata)
